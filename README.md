## Description
App in which user is provided a QR code and can scan other prospective clients/customers QR codes and save them into a prospect list which is sorted into tab views based on whether or not they've been reached out to. User is able to use swipe actions to change their status on if they've been reached out to and even swipe to delete a user. All data is stored using SwiftData and user is able to remind themselves using local notification to reach out to prospects in the future.

## Demos
**Note:** _due to limitations of iOS simulator scanning other's qr codes was mocked_


**Generating a personal QR code other app users can scan**
